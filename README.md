# balloon mission computer 4.01

this is a rewrite of my raspberry pi high altitude balloon software
while previous version was a mix of c and bash scripts, this time it's written in python (as much as possible) so better data flow is possible

new features include:
- SSDV over APRS
- better monitoring and build in tests
- web based remote control for ground operation
